# RGCMod

This is a mod project I created for the game Windward, a unity naval RPG game. I decided to make the project completly open source for the purpose of allowing others to see how a mod like mine is made, what the code is like, and for the most part to be used for educational purposes. I also released the entire mod as a whole release so one may simply add the files to a RGCMod folder inside your windward mods folder and able to run said mod. The code, and mod are open to fair-use, I would prefer if no ones upload the mod with no changes made to it as that would defeat the purpose of my creation of this repo.

As for the Nitty-Gritty or meat and bones of this readme, the files in the source include the DLL project file with all the code for commands, and other features of the mod, inside said project there is the misc files folder which contains the core main files for the mod, such as config edit, mod branding image, symbols for sails. 


In detail the config.txt file contains all the data which the game uses for things such as skills cooldowns, effectiveness of said skills, and ship costs, stats, and much more. I highly suggest you reading through the config file and seeing it's contents. As for Symbols those are simply a images used for sails in game. I highly suggest reading the Windward modding wiki for making custom symbols as they have some unique requirements for specific features the game has, such as repeating or colored symbols and by colored I mean colored specifically and not altered by sail embroidery color which the player can alter in game. 



If you ever have questions it can always be made on the steam workhshops page, as I will have a whole Discussion page just for the GitHub questions, help or other things.
