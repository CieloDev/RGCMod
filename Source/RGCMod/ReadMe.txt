This is the very general ReadMe File for this project. For more clear instruction refer to the GitHub Repo Readme. 

The Misc files contain the config.txt for modifcations for skills and other core game details, as the game loads both C# DLL's
along with allowing overiding game settings via text documents in correct format. From my general understanding the game saves
and loads the core games data like stats, skill maximums and minmums, cooldowns etc as just text, instead of the more common method
of exporting game data as .json files or xml. The images in the Symbols folder are for the sails, and thus must stay in the folder.

For easy installation of mods along with misc files such as symbols, config, it's best to make a folder in the mods folder inside
your /documents/windward/mods folder. For organizational purposes it's best to name the folder after your mod, and this RGCMod
is what I named mine, inside said folder you would place image you want to use for mod on workshop if you plan to upload, version
and info text file including. The symbols folder would then go in, along with a Pennant folder if you made your own pennants, and
the core mod DLL and any other required files accordingly. Refer to the Windward modding guide.
